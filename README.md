# Daisy-3.11
Degrade the linux kernel to be 3.11 for further integration with filesystem and multi-mode 

Basic Method:
- Certify those files that have been added and modified in Daisy
- Add those files into Daisy-3.11

Challenges:
- File and Code lines might be missing during migration
- The difference between 3.11 and 3.12 may really affect the final result
